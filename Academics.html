        I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. My academic journey has been both challenging and rewarding, allowing me to develop a strong foundation in computer science principles, programming languages, and software development methodologies.<br><br>

        Throughout my studies, I have gained hands-on experience in various programming languages such as Java, C++ and C. I am also working on several projects that have enhanced my problem-solving skills and ability to work collaboratively in a team environment. <br><br>

        I passed out my 10th grade from Minerva English Boarding High School and my 12th grade from Kalika Manavgyan Secondary School. From both of these institutions, I have received a solid academic foundation. Eventhough i had choosed Biology in 12Th grade, my love for computer has alays pulled me toward this techological world. My love and passion for technologi=y has pushe me forward for taking more challenges and learning about technologies. These achievements reflect my dedication to academic excellence and my commitment to continuous learning. <br><br>

        I am also a member of STEM SISTERS, acommunity dedicated to empowering women of colour (WOC) in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). This community provides a platform for WOC to connect, share experiences, and support each other in their academic and professional journeys. Through STEM SISTERS, I have had the opportunity to engage with like-minded individuals, participate in workshops, and contribute to initiatives that promote diversity and inclusion in STEM fields.<br><br>
